SimulateIDFA: iOS10 IDFA AD tracking limit solution
==

## Background

Apple updated infos in [advertisingIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/reference/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/1614151-advertisingidentifier) API Reference

```
Important

In iOS 10.0 and later, the value of advertisingIdentifier is all zeroes when the user has limited ad tracking.
```

It means Apple will no longer make the IDFA of users that have limited ad tracking available to developersã€‚

## SimulateIDFA
SimulateIDFA combine many device infos to create an ID that help disambiguate one device from another. 

It includes deviceName,bootTime,countryCode,deviceModel and so on.
